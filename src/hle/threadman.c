/* psprecomp — ThreadManForUser.
 *
 * Threads, semaphores, event flags and callbacks. This is the largest single
 * dependency any PSP game has: `module_start` typically does nothing but
 * create a thread, start it, and return.
 *
 * ## The execution model
 *
 * Default: StartThread runs inline, and unsatisfied waits return a timeout.
 * PSPRECOMP_REAL_THREADS opts into the experimental model described below.
 *
 * Recompiled functions are ordinary C functions over one register file
 * (`psp_cpu`), so the PSP thread model has to be built out of host threads.
 * What this implements, and why it looks the way it does:
 *
 *   - **One host thread per guest thread.** Each `sceKernelStartThread`
 *     creates a host thread and *returns*, which is the point: a game that
 *     starts a worker and then posts work to it never gets past its
 *     `StartThread` call under the old run-to-completion model, because the
 *     worker's body ran inline and never came back. Measured on LocoRoco: the
 *     worker sat in `while (!flag) sleep();` forever, waiting for the work the
 *     still-unreturned caller was going to post.
 *   - **One CPU at a time, handed over explicitly** (the baton below). The PSP
 *     has a single core and never runs two threads at once, so this is both
 *     faithful and the thing that keeps the shared register file coherent:
 *     whoever holds the baton owns `psp_cpu`, and a thread that gives up the
 *     CPU first saves its registers into its own record and reloads them when
 *     it gets the CPU back. A per-thread `HOST_TLS psp_cpu` would be the
 *     other way to do it, and would put a TLS lookup on every register access
 *     in millions of lines of generated code.
 *   - **Waits hand off the CPU.** `SleepThread` parks for one tick (or a
 *     wakeup), `WaitSema`/`WaitEventFlag` retry until signalled or timed out,
 *     `WaitThreadEnd` parks until the target exits, `DelayThread` parks for its
 *     duration (in virtual time -- see the clock below).
 *   - **A wait is also where time passes**, so it is where an interrupt is
 *     delivered (src/hle/intrman.c) and where other threads get the CPU. An
 *     unbounded wait is retried for at most WAIT_TICKS_MAX ticks: a thread
 *     parked on a flag
 *     that nothing will ever set re-checks it every tick instead of deadlocking
 *     the whole run. That is a deliberate approximation -- the faithful
 *     alternative is a run that stops with no evidence in it.
 *
 * ## The clock
 *
 * Time is virtual: `park_us()` advances it by the amount the guest asked for,
 * and a park of an unbounded duration advances it a tick at a time. Real time
 * is capped (`REAL_TICK_US`) so that a game asking for a 100 ms delay does not
 * make a 30 s bring-up run take minutes. 1 ms of guest time therefore costs at
 * most 400 us per host condition wait on POSIX (rounded up to milliseconds
 * on Windows), excluding CPU handover and host scheduling latency. This is a
 * choice about which resource is scarce during bring-up.
 *
 * ## Host stacks
 *
 * Each guest thread gets a host stack of HOST_STACK_BYTES, not the guest stack
 * size: a recompiled call is a C call, so guest call depth is *host* stack
 * depth, and a MIPS frame of 32 bytes becomes a host frame of a few hundred.
 * The guest stack allocation stays exactly what the firmware would have handed
 * the thread, reachable through $sp, so a guest stack overflow still lands
 * where the guest put it.

 * just before a delay had not been scheduled yet when the delay ended (the park
 * waits REAL_TICK_US of *host* time for a wakeup that a delay never gets), so
 * the delay returned before the thread it was supposed to let through had run.
 * A guest never sees that: on one core a started thread of equal priority runs.
 * The starter's own test flaked about one run in ten on it.
 *
 * So the CPU is not taken back while someone wants it. Bounded anyway, and it
 * says so when the bound is reached: the alternative to a capped wait is a run
 * with nothing in it, and a wait that gives up has to be distinguishable from a
 * wait that was never needed. In practice this resolves in microseconds --

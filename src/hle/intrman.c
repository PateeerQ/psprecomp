/* psprecomp — InterruptManager, and the one place an interrupt is delivered.
 *
 * LocoRoco (UCES00304) is what put this file here, and the measurement is worth
 * keeping, because the shape of it is not what the API suggests.
 *
 * Its host reached a loop that ran 2 900 000 000 times in 30 seconds:
 *
 *     while (psp_read32(0x008E4EC4) == 0)     // a flag in the game's own .bss
 *         sceKernelSleepThread();
 *     sceKernelCpuSuspendIntr();              // and a critical-section bracket
 *       ... shared counter ...                // which says what this really is
 *     sceKernelCpuResumeIntr();
 *
 * That flag is armed by a sub-interrupt handler. `sceKernelSleepThread` was
 * already implemented -- as an immediate return, deliberately (threadman.c
 * argued the trade-off) -- so the sleep was not what was missing. These three
 * functions were: the game's registration went nowhere, so no handler could
 * ever run, so the flag could never be armed, so the wait could never end. No
 * amount of implementing `sleep` gets a loop out of that, because the loop's
 * exit condition is set by an interrupt nobody delivers.
 *
 * ## What an interrupt means here
 *
 * There is no timer and no preemption, so there is nothing to interrupt *from*.
 * An interrupt is therefore delivered at the points where the guest itself asks
 * for time to pass: SleepThread, DelayThread and the vblank wait. One wait, one
 * delivery, handlers in registration order, enabled ones only.
 *
 * That is a coarse model, and it is the honest one. It is also the model that
 * lets a *polling* game advance, which the alternative cannot: returning from
 * the wait with nothing delivered leaves the thing being polled for unset,
 * forever.
